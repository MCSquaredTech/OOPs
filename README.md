README file for Project OO-Programming 

This is a video by Mark Zyamota on Pluralsight - He does an excellent job explain the ES6 Object Orient Programming in JavaScript. At this point I have completed much of the object orient aspects of JavaScript it is far different from C# or Python, or many other languages that I have used. In the fleet-data-service.js file I am exploring, as much as possible, how to program to an abstaraction. I have a class called Vehicle that is inherited by Car and Drone so to make the code flexable I am passing the method an object of class Vehicle. 

Program to the Abstraction 
Vehicle 

Car === Vehicle; // true 
Drone === Vehicle; // true 

This is hard in that JavaScript is a loosely typed language.  

Javascript Best Practices - 
file name: Lowercase or snakecase (i.e. app.js or application-project-file.js)
functions: Camelcase (i.e. executeFunction, solve, goToCallBackHell)
classes: Pascalcase (i.e. Drone,  PlayingCards)
